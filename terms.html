        <h2 id="health-disclaimer">9. Health and Mental Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>This section is critically important. Please read it carefully.</p>

        <h3>9.1 Not a medical device or clinical service</h3>
        <p>InnerShadow is a psychoeducation application. It has not been evaluated, cleared, or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or any other regulatory authority as a medical device, diagnostic tool, or treatment for any mental health condition. The Service is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or mental health disorder.</p>

        <h3>9.2 No clinical relationship</h3>
        <p>Your use of the Service does not create any clinical, therapeutic, counselling, or physician-patient relationship between you and InnerShadow or any of its employees, contractors, or content creators. Nothing in the Service constitutes professional mental health advice, and no content should be interpreted as such.</p>

        <h3>9.3 Not a substitute for professional care</h3>
        <p>InnerShadow is not a substitute for professional mental health treatment. If you are experiencing mental health symptoms, emotional distress, suicidal ideation, or any condition requiring professional care, you should seek help from a qualified mental health professional. Do not delay seeking professional help because of something you have read or experienced in the Service.</p>

        <h3>9.4 Crisis situations</h3>
        <p><strong>InnerShadow does not provide crisis intervention services and is not designed for use during mental health emergencies.</strong> If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, suicidal thoughts, or are in immediate danger, you must:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Call or text <strong>988</strong> (Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, available 24/7)</li>
          <li>Call <strong>911</strong> or go to your nearest emergency room</li>
          <li>Contact the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to <strong>741741</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>InnerShadow expressly disclaims any liability for harm, death, or injury resulting from reliance on the Service during a crisis situation or in lieu of emergency services.</p>

        <h3>9.5 Individual results vary</h3>
        <p>The educational content in InnerShadow reflects evidence-informed frameworks and psychological research. However, individual responses to psychoeducational content vary significantly. InnerShadow makes no representations or warranties that use of the Service will produce any particular outcome, improvement in wellbeing, or therapeutic benefit.</p>

        <h2 id="indemnification">12. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless InnerShadow and its officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, affiliates, and licensors from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to:</p>

        <h2 id="arbitration">13. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>

        <div class="arb-card">
          <p><strong>Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights.</strong> It requires binding arbitration for most disputes and limits how you can seek relief.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>13.1 Informal resolution first</h3>
        <p>Before initiating any formal dispute resolution, you agree to contact us at legal@innershadow.app and provide a written description of the dispute, your proposed resolution, and your contact information. We will attempt to resolve the dispute informally within 30 days. Either party may proceed to arbitration if the dispute is not resolved within that period.</p>

        <h3>13.2 Binding arbitration</h3>
        <p>Except as set forth in Section 13.4, you and InnerShadow agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service — including questions of arbitrability — shall be resolved by binding individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court.</p>
        <p>The arbitration shall be conducted in English. For claims under $10,000, the arbitration may be conducted by documents only, by telephone, or by videoconference. For claims over $10,000, the arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

        <h3>13.3 Class action waiver</h3>
        <p><strong>YOU AND INNERSHADOW AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MULTI-PLAINTIFF ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</strong> The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of class or representative proceeding.</p>
        <p>If this class action waiver is found unenforceable, then the agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void with respect to that claim only, and the parties agree to litigate that claim in accordance with Section 14.</p>

        <h3>13.4 Exceptions to arbitration</h3>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may seek relief in small claims court for disputes within the scope of such court's jurisdiction. Either party may also seek emergency injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent irreparable harm pending arbitration.</p>

        <h3>13.5 Arbitration costs</h3>
        <p>Payment of all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees shall be governed by AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. InnerShadow will pay all arbitration fees for claims under $75,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claim was frivolous. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless applicable law or the arbitrator's award provides otherwise.</p>
